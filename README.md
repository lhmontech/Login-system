# Login System

## ℹ️ About the system
The idea here was to put into practice many of the functions I learned in Python. It's a simple login and registration system; it basically has a menu where you can register your user, log in, or close the program. You have three chances to log in. If you enter the wrong password three times, you will be locked out. You cannot use an existing username to register a new username. After logging in to your account, you will have the following options:
    - Check registered users
    - Chek which users are blocked
    - Remove an user
    - Unlock an user
